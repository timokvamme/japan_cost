This package was provided by Hiro Taiyo Hamada who got it from Hao Chen
and was unziped by Timo Kvamme- 24/07/2023

I also downloaded and put the https://www.palamedestoolbox.org/download.html
into the folder. remeber to addpath in matlab

the ahk script  kill_ptb.ahk, can be used to kill ptb. 
download ahk here.  https://www.autohotkey.com  and install. 


in run_all i set: 
if screen.nominalFrameRate ~= 60
if screen.nominalFrameRate ~= 100 
is correct!. 

it should be 100 hz

hz=100 in the beginning in run_all.


In the individual scripts i removed the test of hz:

        %if screen.nominalFrameRate ~= 60
        %    error('fresh rate is not 100 !');
        %end	

by commenting out.
thats because i needed to test it on a 60 hz
